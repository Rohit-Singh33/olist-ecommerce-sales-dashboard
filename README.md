Weekend sales are higher than weekday sales, indicating that customers are more active and likely to place orders during weekends.

**2️ Delivery Time Impacts Review Score**

Faster deliveries receive higher review scores, while delayed deliveries significantly reduce customer satisfaction.

**3️ Top Products Drive Majority of Revenue**

A small number of top products contribute to a large portion of total sales, following the Pareto (80/20) principle.

**4️ Few Cities Generate Most Orders**

Top customer cities account for a major share of total orders, showing strong regional demand concentration.

Higher payment value does not always mean higher profit, highlighting the impact of discounts, logistics, and operational costs.
